## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom styling.
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I have learnt about the different ways of how to structure my workflow from design to final implementation and delivery and i will surely be doing more of these projects on frontend mentor.

### Continued development

I plan on writing the entire thing in a css framework like Bootstrap or tailwind because i think it will be a good addition to my learning journey as an aspiring software developer and help me build my stack and get more experience building in different languages and using different tools.

The use of also a python web framework is a possibility for this type of project.
